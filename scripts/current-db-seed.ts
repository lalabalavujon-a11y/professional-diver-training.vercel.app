## AI Tutor: Dr. Michael Rodriguez - Emergency Medicine Specialist
*Emergency medicine specialist focused on diving-related medical emergencies, hyperbaric treatment, and underwater rescue protocols*

Welcome to professional emergency medical response training! I''m Dr. Michael Rodriguez, your AI tutor specializing in diving medical emergencies. The ABCDE protocol provides a systematic, life-saving approach for managing diving emergencies.

## ABCDE Protocol Professional Framework

### Primary Assessment Sequence
The ABCDE approach requires strict sequential order:
- **A**: Airway management and patency assessment
- **B**: Breathing evaluation and ventilation support
- **C**: Circulation assessment and hemorrhage control
- **D**: Disability (Neurological) evaluation and protection
- **E**: Exposure/Environment control and complete examination

**Critical Principle**: Each step must be completed and stabilized before progressing to the next.

## A - Airway Assessment and Management

### Comprehensive Initial Assessment
Professional **Look, Listen, Feel** systematic approach:
- **Visual Assessment**: Chest movement patterns, facial cyanosis, visible foreign objects
- **Auditory Assessment**: Air movement sounds, vocalization ability, abnormal breathing noises  
- **Tactile Assessment**: Air flow sensation at nose/mouth, chest rise confirmation

### Airway Obstruction Recognition
**Complete Obstruction Emergency Signs**:
- Absent air movement despite obvious respiratory effort
- Silent chest presentation with visible distress
- Rapid progression to unconsciousness and cyanosis
- Complete inability to cough, speak, or vocalize

**Partial Obstruction Warning Signs**:
- Stridor (high-pitched inspiratory sound)
- Significantly diminished air movement
- Use of accessory breathing muscles
- Anxiety and agitation from developing hypoxia

### Professional Management Techniques

#### Basic Airway Management
1. **Head Tilt-Chin Lift**: Primary positioning technique for unconscious patients
2. **Jaw Thrust**: Alternative for suspected spinal injury
3. **Manual Removal**: Finger sweep for visible foreign objects
4. **Patient Positioning**: Log roll for drainage with spinal alignment

## Diving-Specific Emergencies

### Decompression Sickness Assessment

## AI Tutor: Captain James Mitchell - Commercial Dive Supervisor
*Veteran dive supervisor with expertise in dive planning, risk assessment, and emergency response coordination*

Comprehensive risk assessment and hazard management form the cornerstone of safe commercial diving operations. This module covers systematic risk identification, assessment methodologies, and mitigation strategies.

## Professional Risk Assessment Framework

### Systematic Hazard Identification

#### Environmental Hazard Categories
**Marine Environment Hazards**:
- **Weather Conditions**: Sea state limitations, wind parameters, visibility restrictions
- **Water Quality**: Temperature extremes, contamination risks, biological hazards
- **Current and Tidal Forces**: Working current limits, tidal variations
- **Marine Traffic**: Commercial vessels, shipping lanes, fishing activity

#### Operational Risk Categories
**Equipment-Related Hazards**:
- **Life Support Failures**: Breathing gas interruption, gas contamination
- **Communication Failures**: Hard-wire loss, wireless interference
- **Tool Malfunctions**: Power tool failures, cutting equipment problems
- **PPE Issues**: Diving suit integrity, helmet malfunction

### Professional Risk Matrix Development

#### Risk Probability Assessment Scale
- **Very Low (1)**: Extremely unlikely occurrence
- **Low (2)**: Unlikely but possible, rare occurrence
- **Medium (3)**: Possible occurrence, occasional
- **High (4)**: Likely occurrence, regular
- **Very High (5)**: Almost certain occurrence

#### Consequence Severity Scale
- **Negligible (1)**: Minor inconvenience, no significant impact
- **Minor (2)**: Small delays, minor equipment damage
- **Moderate (3)**: Significant delays, moderate injuries
- **Major (4)**: Substantial impact, serious injuries
- **Catastrophic (5)**: Fatalities, major environmental impact

**Risk Score**: Probability √ó Consequence = Risk Score

### Hazard Control Hierarchy

#### Control Methods (Most to Least Effective)
1. **Elimination**: Complete hazard removal
2. **Substitution**: Safer alternatives
3. **Engineering Controls**: Physical modifications
4. **Administrative Controls**: Procedures and training
5. **Personal Protective Equipment**: Individual protection

      ('${airDiverTrack.id}', 'Gas Management and Consumption Planning', 1, '# Gas Management and Consumption Planning

## AI Tutor: Lisa Thompson - Professional Air Diving Instructor
*Professional air diving instructor specializing in gas management, ascent procedures, and underwater tool handling safety*

Proper gas management forms the foundation of safe air diving operations. This comprehensive module covers consumption calculation methodologies, emergency reserve planning, and supply monitoring techniques.

## Gas Consumption Fundamentals

### Physiological Consumption Factors
Individual variation in gas consumption rates:

#### Physical Characteristics Impact
- **Body Mass Index**: Larger individuals typically require higher gas volumes
- **Lung Capacity**: Vital capacity directly affects breathing efficiency
- **Physical Conditioning**: Cardiovascular fitness reduces consumption rates
- **Age and Health**: Respiratory efficiency changes with age

#### Psychological Influences
- **Experience Level**: Novice divers consume 50-100% more than experienced divers
- **Stress Response**: Anxiety can double or triple consumption rates
- **Task Familiarity**: Unfamiliar work increases mental load and gas use
- **Emergency Situations**: Panic responses can increase consumption 300-400%

### Environmental Consumption Variables

#### Depth-Related Consumption Changes
Gas consumption increases linearly with absolute pressure:
- **Surface (1 ATA)**: Baseline consumption measurement
- **33 feet (2 ATA)**: Exactly double surface consumption
- **66 feet (3 ATA)**: Triple surface consumption rate
- **99 feet (4 ATA)**: Quadruple surface consumption rate

**Formula**: Surface Rate √ó (Depth in feet + 33) √∑ 33 = Depth Consumption Rate

#### Work Load Categories
Professional diving work classification:
- **Light Work (1.5-2.0 CFM)**: Visual inspection, light cleaning
- **Moderate Work (2.0-3.0 CFM)**: Power tool operation, moderate effort
- **Heavy Work (3.0-4.5 CFM)**: Cutting, welding, heavy lifting
- **Emergency Operations (4.5-6.0+ CFM)**: Rescue operations, high stress

### Professional Gas Planning

#### Complete Gas Requirement Formula
**Total Gas = (Work Time √ó Consumption Rate √ó Depth Factor) + Emergency Reserves + Operational Reserves + Surface Reserves**

#### Reserve Requirements
- **Emergency Reserve**: 25% of total calculated consumption
- **Emergency Ascent**: 50 cubic feet minimum for ascent
- **Task Overrun**: 20% additional for extended work time
- **Surface Reserve**: 50 cubic feet minimum

### Critical Decision Points
- **Turn-Around Pressure (50%)**: Begin ascent initiation
- **Emergency Reserve (25%)**: Emergency use only
- **Surface Reserve (200 PSI)**: Final safety margin

This comprehensive gas management training ensures safe, efficient diving operations while maintaining adequate safety margins.')
