**AI Tutor: Dr. Michael Rodriguez - Emergency Medicine Specialist**

The ABCDE approach provides a systematic method for assessing and managing diving emergencies, ensuring critical priorities are addressed in the correct sequence.

## ABCDE Protocol Overview

### Primary Assessment Sequence
The ABCDE approach must be followed in strict order:
- **A**: Airway
- **B**: Breathing  
- **C**: Circulation
- **D**: Disability (Neurological)

  // Air Diver Track Lessons
  const [airLesson1] = await db.insert(lessons).values({
    trackId: airDiverTrack.id,
    title: "Gas Management and Consumption Planning",
    order: 1,
    content: `# Gas Management and Consumption Planning

**AI Tutor: Lisa Thompson - Professional Air Diving Instructor**

Proper gas management is the foundation of safe air diving operations. This module covers consumption calculation, emergency reserves, and supply monitoring for professional diving applications.

## Gas Consumption Fundamentals

### Physiological Factors
Individual consumption rates vary significantly based on:

#### Physical Characteristics
- **Body Size**: Larger individuals typically consume more gas
- **Lung Capacity**: Vital capacity affects breathing efficiency
- **Physical Fitness**: Better conditioning reduces consumption
- **Age and Health**: Medical conditions affecting respiratory function

#### Psychological Factors
- **Experience Level**: Experienced divers typically consume less
- **Stress Response**: Anxiety increases consumption dramatically
- **Task Confidence**: Familiar tasks require less mental energy
- **Emergency Situations**: Can triple or quadruple consumption rates

### Environmental Influences

#### Depth Effects
Gas consumption increases proportionally with absolute pressure:
- **Surface (1 ATA)**: Baseline consumption rate
- **33 feet (2 ATA)**: Double surface consumption
- **66 feet (3 ATA)**: Triple surface consumption
- **99 feet (4 ATA)**: Quadruple surface consumption

**Formula**: Consumption Rate = Surface Rate Ã— (Depth in feet + 33) Ã· 33

#### Work Load Categories
Professional diving work categories and typical consumption rates:
- **Light Work**: 1.5-2.0 CFM (inspection, light cleaning)
- **Moderate Work**: 2.0-3.0 CFM (tool operation, moderate physical effort)
- **Heavy Work**: 3.0-4.5 CFM (cutting, heavy lifting, strenuous tasks)
- **Emergency Work**: 4.5-6.0+ CFM (rescue operations, high stress situations)

## Professional Planning Methods

### Pre-Dive Calculations

#### Basic Gas Requirements
**Total Gas = (Work Time Ã— Consumption Rate Ã— Depth Factor) + Reserves**

**Example Calculation for 60-foot working dive**:
- Planned work time: 45 minutes
- Diver consumption rate: 2.5 CFM (moderate work)
- Depth factor: 2.8 ATA (60 feet)
- Work gas required: 45 Ã— 2.5 Ã— 2.8 = 315 cubic feet
- Emergency reserve (25%): 315 Ã— 0.25 = 79 cubic feet
- Surface reserve: 50 cubic feet minimum
- **Total Required**: 315 + 79 + 50 = 444 cubic feet minimum

#### Reserve Requirements
Professional diving requires multiple reserve categories:

**Emergency Reserves**:
- **Primary Reserve**: 25% of total calculated consumption
- **Emergency Ascent**: 50 cubic feet minimum for ascent and surface
- **Emergency Work**: Additional gas for emergency response tasks
- **Communication Loss**: Extended bottom time contingency

**Operational Reserves**:
- **Task Overrun**: 20% additional for extended work time
- **Equipment Problems**: Gas for problem solving and recovery
- **Weather Delays**: Surface interval extensions
- **Multiple Ascents**: Repeat descents for forgotten items

### Supply System Planning

#### Surface Supply Systems
**Compressor Capacity Requirements**:
- **Primary Diver Supply**: Maximum anticipated consumption rate
- **Standby Diver Supply**: Ready for immediate deployment
- **System Losses**: Distribution and regulation losses
- **Emergency Capacity**: Additional 50% minimum for emergencies

**Example System Sizing**:
- Primary diver: 4.0 CFM maximum (heavy work at depth)
- Standby diver: 4.0 CFM capability
- System losses: 15% (distribution, regulation)
- Emergency factor: 50%
- **Required Compressor**: (4.0 + 4.0) Ã— 1.15 Ã— 1.5 = 13.8 CFM minimum

#### SCUBA Configuration
**Tank Selection and Configuration**:
- **Single Tank**: Limited capacity, simple configuration
- **Double Tanks**: Doubled capacity, redundancy options
- **Manifolded Doubles**: Shared gas, maximum capacity
- **Independent Doubles**: Full redundancy, complex management

## Real-Time Monitoring

### Continuous Assessment
Professional divers must maintain constant awareness:

#### Pressure Monitoring
- **Initial Pressure**: Full supply verification
- **Working Pressure**: Consumption rate tracking
- **Reserve Pressure**: Emergency limit identification
- **Critical Pressure**: Immediate ascent initiation

#### Consumption Rate Tracking
**Real-time calculation method**:
1. Note starting pressure and time
2. Calculate pressure drop over time interval
3. Convert pressure drop to volume consumed
4. Adjust for current depth pressure
5. Project remaining work time available

**Example Real-Time Calculation**:
- Tank: 3000 PSI, 80 cubic feet capacity
- After 15 minutes at 60 feet: 2400 PSI remaining
- Pressure used: 3000 - 2400 = 600 PSI
- Volume used: 600 Ã· 3000 Ã— 80 = 16 cubic feet
- Actual consumption: 16 CFM Ã· 15 minutes Ã· 2.8 ATA = 0.38 surface CFM
- Projected rate seems low - verify calculations and monitor closely

### Decision Points

#### Critical Pressure Management
Establish clear decision pressures before diving:
- **Turn-Around Pressure**: Begin ascent initiation (typically 50% remaining)
- **Emergency Reserve**: No further consumption except emergencies (25% remaining)
- **Surface Reserve**: Final safety margin (200 PSI minimum)
- **Equipment Reserve**: Post-dive system pressure maintenance

#### Emergency Procedures
When gas supplies are critically low:
1. **Immediate Ascent**: Begin controlled ascent immediately
2. **Reduce Consumption**: Minimize physical exertion
3. **Emergency Procedures**: Implement bailout or buddy breathing
4. **Surface Communication**: Notify support team immediately
5. **Alternative Supplies**: Deploy emergency gas if available

## Advanced Planning Techniques

### Multi-Level Diving
For diving operations at varying depths:
- **Average Depth Method**: Use weighted average depth
- **Segment Analysis**: Calculate each depth segment separately
- **Maximum Depth Method**: Conservative approach using deepest depth
- **Computer Integration**: Use dive computers for precise tracking

### Team Gas Management
Multiple diver operations require coordinated planning:
- **Individual Calculations**: Each diver's specific requirements
- **Shared Resources**: Common gas supply considerations
- **Emergency Sharing**: Buddy breathing or emergency supply protocols
- **Staggered Operations**: Sequential diving to conserve total gas

## Safety Protocols

### Pre-Dive Verification
Before every dive, verify:
- **Supply Pressure**: Full tanks or adequate compressor operation
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Double-check all mathematical calculations
- **Emergency Procedures**: Review bailout and emergency ascent plans
- **Communication**: Establish gas monitoring communication protocols

### Emergency Response
Gas emergency response priorities:
1. **Safety First**: Never compromise diver safety for operational goals
2. **Conservative Decisions**: When in doubt, ascend early
3. **Emergency Protocols**: Implement established emergency procedures
4. **Post-Event Analysis**: Review incidents to improve future planning

This comprehensive approach to gas management ensures safe, efficient diving operations while maintaining adequate safety margins for emergency response and equipment failures.`,
