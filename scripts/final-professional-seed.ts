### Professional Risk Matrix Development

#### Risk Probability Assessment Scale
Professional evaluation of event likelihood:

- **Low (2)**: Unlikely but possible, rare occurrence in similar operations
- **Medium (3)**: Possible occurrence, occasional in similar operations
- **High (4)**: Likely occurrence, regular occurrence in similar operations
- **Very High (5)**: Almost certain occurrence, frequent occurrence in similar operations

#### Consequence Severity Professional Scale
Assessment of potential impact magnitude:
- **Negligible (1)**: Minor inconvenience, no significant impact on operations or personnel
- **Minor (2)**: Small operational delays, minor equipment damage, first aid level injuries
- **Moderate (3)**: Significant operational delays, moderate equipment damage, medical treatment injuries
- **Major (4)**: Substantial project impact, major equipment loss, serious injuries requiring hospitalization
- **Catastrophic (5)**: Fatalities, major environmental impact, project termination, regulatory shutdown

#### Risk Score Calculation and Interpretation
**Risk Score Formula**: Probability × Consequence = Risk Score

**Risk Level Interpretation**:
- **Low Risk (1-4)**: Acceptable with standard precautions and monitoring
- **Medium Risk (5-9)**: Requires specific mitigation measures and enhanced monitoring
- **High Risk (10-16)**: Requires comprehensive mitigation and continuous management
- **Very High Risk (17-25)**: Unacceptable without major mitigation or operation modification
