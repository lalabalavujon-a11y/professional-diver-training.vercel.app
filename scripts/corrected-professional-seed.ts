    content: `# Visual Inspection Fundamentals - NDT Training

**AI Tutor: Dr. Sarah Chen - NDT Inspection Specialist**

Visual inspection forms the foundation of underwater non-destructive testing, requiring systematic methodology and professional expertise.

## Systematic Grid Pattern Methodology

### Grid Pattern Advantages
The systematic grid pattern technique is the **primary advantage** for underwater visual inspection because it:
- **Ensures complete systematic coverage** with quality assurance verification
- **Eliminates missed critical structural areas** through methodical progression
- Provides documentation of inspection completeness
- Enables quality assurance verification and audit trails

### Corrosion Assessment

#### Galvanic Corrosion
**Most commonly associated with dissimilar metal connections** in marine environments:
- Occurs when dissimilar metals are in electrical contact in seawater
- Creates galvanic cells with preferential anode attack at connection points
- Requires electrochemical galvanic series analysis for proper assessment

#### Pitting Corrosion
- **Localized deep penetration**, not uniform surface degradation
- High depth-to-diameter ratios characterize pitting damage
- Distinguished from general corrosion by localized attack patterns

### Cathodic Protection Standards

#### NACE Standards
According to **NACE industry standards** for cathodic protection:
- **Minimum protection potential**: -850 mV (Ag/AgCl reference electrode)
- Requires instant-off potential measurement for accurate assessment
- Silver/Silver Chloride reference electrode is industry standard

## Environmental Factors Affecting Inspection

### Critical Environmental Considerations
Three key environmental factors significantly impacting inspection quality:
1. **Visibility limitations** - water clarity and lighting conditions
2. **Current effects** - impact on diver stability and inspection accuracy  
3. **Depth considerations** - narcosis effects and time limitations

## Professional Documentation
All inspections must follow professional standards with systematic documentation and quality assurance verification.`,

    content: `# Emergency Response Protocols - ABCDE Assessment

**AI Tutor: Dr. Michael Rodriguez - Emergency Medicine Specialist**

The ABCDE approach provides systematic emergency assessment for diving emergencies, ensuring critical priorities are addressed in correct sequence.

## ABCDE Protocol Overview

### Professional ABCDE Sequence
The correct systematic sequence and primary clinical focus:
- **A**: **Airway patency assessment** - ensure clear airway
- **B**: **Breathing adequacy evaluation** - assess ventilation effectiveness  
- **C**: **Circulation status check** - evaluate cardiovascular function
- **D**: **Disability neurological assessment** - check neurological status
- **E**: **Exposure complete examination** with sequential stabilization

## Decompression Sickness Classification

### Type I vs Type II DCS
**Primary clinical difference**:

**Type I DCS**:
- Involves mild joint pain and skin manifestations
- Lower treatment urgency priority
- Generally affects musculoskeletal system
- Less immediate life threat

**Type II DCS**:
- Involves serious **neurological and pulmonary complications**
- **Requires immediate intervention** and emergency treatment
- Affects central nervous system and vital organs
- Life-threatening emergency requiring urgent hyperbaric treatment

## Arterial Gas Embolism (AGE) Management

### Optimal Treatment Protocol
**Emergency management for AGE**:
- **Left lateral recumbent position** (optimal positioning)
- **Immediate high-flow oxygen therapy** (100% oxygen)
- **Urgent hyperbaric facility evacuation** (emergency transport)

This positioning prevents further air embolism migration while high-flow oxygen maximizes dissolved oxygen content.

## Professional Emergency Protocols
All emergency responses require systematic assessment with immediate life-saving interventions taking priority over diagnostic procedures.`,
