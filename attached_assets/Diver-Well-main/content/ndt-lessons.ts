## Welcome to Your NDT AI Tutor

I'm your specialized AI tutor for Non-Destructive Testing and Inspection. I'll guide you through the fundamentals of visual inspection with real-world applications and industry best practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Master visual inspection principles and techniques
- Understand equipment requirements and selection
- Learn systematic inspection procedures
- Develop documentation and reporting skills
- Identify common surface defects and anomalies

## Core Concepts

### What is Visual Inspection?
Visual inspection is the primary and most fundamental NDT method used in underwater inspection. It provides immediate assessment of surface conditions and is often the first step in any inspection program.

**Key Principle**: "If you can see it, you can document it."

### Equipment Requirements
- **High-intensity underwater lights**: Minimum 10,000 lumens for deep water
- **Video recording equipment**: 4K resolution with macro capabilities
- **Measuring tools and scales**: Calibrated rulers and depth gauges
- **Clean surfaces for reference**: Standard cleaning materials

## Inspection Procedures

### 1. Pre-inspection Planning
- Review previous inspection reports
- Identify areas of concern
- Plan inspection sequence
- Check equipment functionality

### 2. Surface Preparation
- Remove marine growth where necessary
- Clean surfaces for better visibility
- Mark inspection areas
- Establish reference points

### 3. Systematic Inspection
- Follow predetermined grid patterns
- Document all findings with photos/video
- Measure defect dimensions
- Record environmental conditions

## Common Defects to Identify

### Corrosion Types
- **General Corrosion**: Uniform metal loss across surface
- **Pitting Corrosion**: Localized deep penetration
- **Galvanic Corrosion**: Accelerated corrosion of less noble metal
- **Crevice Corrosion**: Localized attack in confined spaces

### Structural Defects
- **Cracking**: Stress corrosion, fatigue cracks
- **Deformation**: Buckling, denting, warping
- **Coating Damage**: Blistering, peeling, delamination
- **Weld Defects**: Undercut, porosity, lack of fusion

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pipeline Inspection
You're inspecting a 24-inch diameter pipeline at 30m depth. The pipeline shows signs of corrosion. How do you proceed?

**AI Tutor Guidance**:
1. Establish inspection grid pattern
2. Document corrosion extent and type
3. Measure corrosion depth
4. Photograph with scale references
5. Record environmental conditions

### Scenario 2: Hull Inspection
During a vessel hull inspection, you discover a crack. What's your immediate action?

**AI Tutor Guidance**:
1. Document crack location and orientation
2. Measure crack dimensions
3. Assess crack severity
4. Mark location for follow-up
5. Report immediately to supervisor

## Assessment Questions

- B) 10,000 lumens
- C) 15,000 lumens
- D) 20,000 lumens

**Correct Answer**: B) 10,000 lumens

## Next Steps
In the next lesson, we'll explore corrosion assessment techniques in detail. You'll learn about different corrosion types, measurement methods, and reporting requirements.

Remember: Visual inspection is the foundation of all NDT work. Master this, and you'll have a solid base for advanced techniques.`

## Welcome Back to Your NDT AI Tutor

In this lesson, I'll guide you through comprehensive corrosion assessment techniques. Corrosion is the most common defect you'll encounter in marine environments.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify different types of marine corrosion
- Master corrosion measurement techniques
- Learn corrosion rate calculations
- Understand prevention and mitigation strategies
- Develop comprehensive reporting skills

## Types of Marine Corrosion

### 1. General Corrosion
**Description**: Uniform metal loss across surface
**Causes**: Electrochemical reactions with seawater
**Assessment**: Measure thickness loss, document patterns
**Prevention**: Protective coatings, cathodic protection

**AI Tutor Tip**: General corrosion is often the easiest to measure but can be the most dangerous if left unchecked.

### 2. Pitting Corrosion
**Description**: Localized deep penetration
**Causes**: Chloride ions, stagnant conditions
**Assessment**: Count pits, measure depth, document distribution
**Prevention**: Proper material selection, regular cleaning

**AI Tutor Tip**: Pitting corrosion can cause rapid failure even with minimal metal loss.

### 3. Galvanic Corrosion
**Description**: Accelerated corrosion of less noble metal
**Causes**: Contact between dissimilar metals
**Assessment**: Identify metal combinations, measure corrosion rates
**Prevention**: Electrical isolation, sacrificial anodes

**AI Tutor Tip**: Always check for dissimilar metal contact in your inspection area.

### 4. Crevice Corrosion
**Description**: Localized attack in confined spaces
**Causes**: Oxygen concentration differences
**Assessment**: Inspect joints, fasteners, overlapping areas
**Prevention**: Proper design, regular cleaning

## Assessment Techniques

### Visual Assessment
- Document corrosion patterns
- Measure affected areas
- Photograph with scale references
- Note environmental conditions

### Thickness Measurements
- Use ultrasonic thickness gauges
- Take multiple readings per area
- Compare with original specifications
- Calculate corrosion rates

### Corrosion Rate Calculation
\`\`\`
Corrosion Rate = (Original Thickness - Current Thickness) / Time
\`\`\`

**Example**: If a 10mm plate has corroded to 8mm over 2 years:
Corrosion Rate = (10mm - 8mm) / 2 years = 1mm/year

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Offshore Platform Leg
You're inspecting a platform leg and find extensive pitting corrosion. The original thickness was 25mm, current measurements show 20mm average with pits up to 8mm deep.

**AI Tutor Analysis**:
1. **Corrosion Type**: Pitting corrosion
2. **Severity**: High (pits exceed 30% of wall thickness)
3. **Action Required**: Immediate remedial action
4. **Recommendation**: Ultrasonic mapping, structural assessment

### Scenario 2: Pipeline Corrosion
A 12-inch pipeline shows uniform corrosion. Original thickness: 15mm, current: 12mm over 3 years.

**AI Tutor Analysis**:
1. **Corrosion Type**: General corrosion
2. **Rate**: 1mm/year
3. **Remaining Life**: 9 years at current rate
4. **Action**: Monitor and plan replacement
