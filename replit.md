## API Design
RESTful endpoints following conventional patterns:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication and session management
- `/api/tracks/*` - Learning track operations
- `/api/lessons/*` - Lesson content and management
- `/api/quizzes/*` - Quiz functionality and submissions
- `/api/admin/*` - Administrative operations

## Content Management
- **Rich Text Content**: Markdown-supported lesson content
- **Sequential Learning**: Ordered lessons within tracks
