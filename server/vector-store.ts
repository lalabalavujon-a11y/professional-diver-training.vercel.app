NDT is a critical component of underwater inspection operations in commercial diving. This discipline focuses on evaluating the integrity of underwater structures without causing damage.

Key NDT Methods:
- Visual Inspection: Systematic examination of surfaces for defects
- Ultrasonic Testing: Using sound waves to detect internal flaws
- Magnetic Particle Testing: Detecting surface and near-surface cracks
- Dye Penetrant Testing: Identifying surface-breaking defects
- Eddy Current Testing: Detecting surface and subsurface flaws

Safety Protocols:
- Pre-dive safety briefings
- Equipment calibration and verification
- Emergency procedures and communication protocols
- Documentation standards for regulatory compliance

Industry Standards:
- IMCA guidelines for underwater inspection
- ADCI standards for commercial diving operations
- OSHA regulations for workplace safety
- ASTM standards for NDT procedures

Career Development:
- NDT Level I, II, and III certifications
- Specialized training in advanced NDT methods
- Continuing education requirements
- Professional development opportunities`,
